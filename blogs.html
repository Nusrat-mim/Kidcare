                        <h3>When to worry about your child's fever</h3>
                        
                        <p>Fevers are very common. They are part of how the body fights infection. The average child will get several viral infections a year — which means several fevers. The vast majority of fevers are nothing to worry about, and pass in a day or two.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, though, parents should worry. Here are some circumstances when you should be worried about a fever and seek medical attention immediately:</p>
                        <p>If your child is less than 3 months old. While most fevers in newborns turn out just fine, their defenses are still getting up and going and they aren’t very good at telling us what hurts.</p>

                        <p>The associations in the study were found to go in both directions; better well-being was associated with consumption of fruit and vegetables in accordance with dietary guidelines, better self-esteem was associated with limited intake of refined sugars, good parent relations were associated with fruit and vegetable consumption according to guidelines, fewer emotional problems were associated with fat intake according to guidelines and fewer peer problems were associated with consumption of fruit and vegetables according to guidelines</p>

                        <p>Teach your child about how a real friend is. A real friend is a person upon whom they can trust, a person who picks them up when they are down and helps them no matter how bad the situation is. A person who talks to them nicely is not always the real one. But the one who became rude but does what is right for your child is the true friend.</p>
